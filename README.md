# ⚡ Electrical Projects by George

Welcome to my personal collection of electrical and electronics projects. As an Electrical Engineering student, I use this repository to document my hands-on learning journey — building circuits, experimenting with components, and exploring the fundamentals of electronics.

Each project includes:
- 🧰 Components list  
- 📷 Breadboard images or schematics  
- 🧠 How it works (explanation)  
- ✅ Status (Tested, In progress, or Planned)
